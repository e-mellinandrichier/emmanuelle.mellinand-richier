# Hi there ! ðŸ‘‹
My name is Emmanuelle Mellinand-Richier, I'm currently a student at La Plateforme Marseille. Coding has been my passion since 2 years, I discovered it during my Webdev bootcamp at Le Wagon Marseille in winter 2022, and loved it ever since. \
I had the amazing opportunity to do the 42's Piscine in Lyon, which has given me a ton of knowledge on coding, but also a lot of interpersonal skills.

## My favorite projects 

* Tic Tac Toe\
  At La Plateforme, we had to code a functionnal Tic Tac Toe in Python
* Humanoidax\
  A futuristic Airbnb style website, where you can rent robots to do stuff for you eg. a robot yoga teacher, babysitter, chef...
* Cyberclosette\
  Inspired by the film Clueless, I've always been in awe in front of Cher's virtual closet. We've decided to recreate it for our final project at Le Wagon. [Check out our presentation !](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SNrAxARnX0)
